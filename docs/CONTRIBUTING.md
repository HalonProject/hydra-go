# How to contribute

Thanks for taking the time to contribute to this highly experimental project. If
you have questions about the usage of this package it is highly recommended that
you check out the example(s) in the `examples` folder. Or you can look at the godoc
documentation (WIP).

## Issues

When filing a issue please include as much information as you can. This includes
code snippets, examples, and stack traces if possible. This is an experimental project
that is still being developed so there will be some oddities that may not have been
thought of.

If you have an enhancement that you would like to see added feel free to add this
as an issue. If we feel that it is something that should be added we will mark it
as a `enhancement` and will prioritize it as we see fit.

## Submitting changes

You are welcome to make a PR for changes that you see fit. We ask that since this
is a go project that all go file are formatted using `go fmt`. Also if you are adding
functionality you should update/create tests to the best of your ability to ensure
that your changes behave as expected. NOTE: We will not merge PRs that should have
tests and none are provided.

All tests should pass and the code coverage should remain the same or increase
coverage.
